# Pentesting with AI?
Relationship between AI and penetration testing? Would AI help us to do penetration testing? Excited about that topic!
---------------------------Self Intro----------------------------
* This is Bob - a student currently being enrolled in Ulink College of Shanghai
* You could contact me via email: 1023939450@qq.com if you have some good ideas about the topic or anything about the code I would be really appreciated to see that and do my best to help you. I have studied 3 languages and you could communicate with me using 中文、English&日本語(Just a little bit). If you do not prefer to use any of those languages I would suggest you translate it into English(Since translate to English would be more accurate for most translation tools).
-------------------Little bit about donating-----------------------
Researching of AI is time-consuming and it costs a lot of money to rent a high-performance server
I would be really appreciated if you could donate a little bit so that the research can be continued...
Donating links are at the bottom of the page(Since I don't have any contributions yet the link is currently unavailable)

# Ideas have to think about
- Combination of AI and Penetration Testing
- Teach AI to use penetration testing tools? Or teach them how to write a penetration testing tool?
- Discovery of 0 days or scanning for currently discovered bugs or what about both?
- Where to start?
    * Machine Learning? Teaching AI where would those bugs likely to happen?
    * Combination of common pen-testing tools and common commands?
    * ...(To be continued)
- I would consider using python to do the coding part and maybe HUAWEI cloud? to do the computing part?

To be continued... If you have some thoughts or suggestions please contact me via email or you could just raise an issue or pull requests. I would reply as soon as possible!
